	abstract = {Studies involving large observational datasets commonly face the challenge of dealing with multiple missing values. The most popular approach to overcome this challenge, multiple imputation using chained equations, however, has been shown to be sub-optimal in complex settings, specifically in settings with longitudinal outcomes, which cannot be easily and adequately included in the imputation models. Bayesian methods avoid this difficulty by specification of a joint distribution and thus offer an alternative. A popular choice for that joint distribution is the multivariate normal distribution. In more complicated settings, as in our two motivating examples that involve time-varying covariates, additional issues require consideration: the endo- or exogeneity of the covariate and its functional relation with the outcome. In such situations, the implied assumptions of standard methods may be violated, resulting in bias. In this work, we extend and study a more flexible, Bayesian alternative to the multivariate normal approach, to better handle complex incomplete longitudinal data. We discuss and compare assumptions of the two Bayesian approaches about the endo- or exogeneity of the covariates and the functional form of the association with the outcome, and illustrate and evaluate consequences of violations of those assumptions using simulation studies and two real data examples.},

	abstract = {Standard models for longitudinal data ignore the stochastic nature of time-varying covariates and their stochastic evolution over time by treating them as fixed variables. There have been recent methods for modelling time-varying covariates; however, those methods cannot be applied to analyse longitudinal data when the longitudinal response and the time-varying covariates for each subject are measured at different time points. Moreover, it is difficult to study the temporal effects of a time-varying covariate on the longitudinal response and the temporal correlation between them. Motivated by data from an {AIDS} cohort study conducted over 26 years at the University Hospitals Leuven in which the measurements on the {CD}4 cell count and viral load for patients are not taken at the same time point, we present a framework to address those challenges by using joint multivariate mixed models to jointly model time-varying covariates and a longitudinal response, instead of including time-varying covariates in the response model. This approach also has the advantage that one can study the association between the covariate at any time point and the response at any other time point without having to explicitly model the conditional distribution of the response given the covariate. We use penalised spline functions of time to capture the evolutions of both the response and time-varying covariates over time.},

	abstract = {Social scientists are often interested in estimating the marginal effects of a time-varying treatment on an end-of-study continuous outcome. With observational data, estimating these effects is complicated by the presence of time-varying confounders affected by prior treatments, which may lead to bias in conventional regression and matching estimators. In this situation, inverse-probability-of-treatment-weighted ({IPTW}) estimation of a marginal structural model remains unbiased if treatment assignment is sequentially ignorable and the conditional probability of treatment is correctly modeled, but this method is not without limitations. In particular, it is difficult to use with continuous treatments, and it is relatively inefficient. This article explores using an alternative regression-based method—regression-with-residuals ({RWR}) estimation of a constrained structural nested mean model—that may overcome some of these limitations in practice. It is unbiased for the marginal effects of a time-varying treatment if treatment assignment is sequentially ignorable, the treatment effects of interest are invariant across levels of the confounders, and a model for the conditional mean of the outcome is correctly specified. The performance of {RWR} estimation relative to {IPTW} estimation is evaluated with a series of simulation experiments and with an empirical example based on longitudinal data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. Results indicate that it may outperform {IPTW} estimation in certain situations.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}For several decades, cross-lagged panel models ({CLPM}) have been the dominant statistical model in relationship research for investigating reciprocal associations between two (or more) constructs over time. However, recent methodological research has questioned the frequent usage of the {CLPM} because, amongst other things, the model commingles within-person associations with between-person associations, while most developmental research questions pertain to within-person processes. Furthermore, the model presumes that there are no third variables that confound the relationships between the longitudinally assessed variables. Therefore, the usage of alternative models such as the Random-Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Model ({RI}-{CLPM}) or the Latent Curve Model with Structured Residuals ({LCM}-{SR}) has been suggested. These models separate between-person from within-person variation and they also control for time constant covariates. However, there might also be third variables that are not stable but rather change across time and that can confound the relationships between the variables studied in these models. In the present article, we explain the differences between the two types of confounders and investigate how they affect the parameter estimates of within-person models such as the {RI}-{CLPM} and the {LCM}-{SR}.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Using a simple pretest–posttest design in a linear setting, this paper translates the conventional algebraic formalization of {FE} and {RE} models into causal graphs and provides intuitively accessible graphical explanations about their data-generating and bias-removing processes. The proposed causal graphs highlight that {FE} and {RE} models consider different data-generating models. {RE} models presume a data-generating model that is identical to a randomized controlled trial, while {FE} models allow for unobserved time-invariant treatment–outcome confounding. Augmenting regular causal graphs that describe data-generating processes by adding the computational structures of {FE} and {RE} estimators, the paper visualizes how {FE} estimators (gain score and deviation score estimators) and {RE} estimators (quasi-deviation score estimators) offset unmeasured confounding bias. In contrast to standard regression or matching estimators that reduce confounding bias by blocking non-causal paths via conditioning, {FE} and {RE} estimators offset confounding bias by deliberately creating new non-causal paths and associations of opposite sign. Though {FE} and {RE} estimators are similar in their bias-offsetting mechanisms, the augmented graphs reveal their subtle differences that can result in different biases in observational studies.},

However, in contrast to other modeling strategies, there is currently no widely used approach for graphically diagramming multilevel models. Ideally, such diagrams would serve two functions: to provide a formal structure for deriving the underlying equations and to provide a mechanism for clearly and efficiently communicating the model structure, assumptions, and empirical results. Here the authors propose a path diagramming approach for multilevel models that seeks to meet these goals. The authors begin with a description of the core components of their proposed diagramming system and establish tracing rules for the direct derivation of model equations. They then demonstrate their approach using several published empirical multilevel applications and conclude with potential limitations and directions for future developments.
