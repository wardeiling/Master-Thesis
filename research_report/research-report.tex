\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Across a wide range of disciplines, researchers analyze clustered
longitudinal, observational data to investigate prospective causal
relationships between variables. When analyzing such data, psychological
researchers most commonly use the multilevel linear model\footnote{The
  MLM is known by various names in different substantive fields,
  including: linear mixed model, hierarchical linear model,
  random-effect model and mixed-effects model.} (MLM,
\citeproc{ref-bauer2011}{Bauer \& Sterba, 2011}), which---in the context
of longitudinal data analysis---partitions observed variance into stable
between-person differences and within-person fluctuations
(\citeproc{ref-hamaker2020}{Hamaker \& Muth√©n, 2020}). In the
application of the MLM, time invariant and time-varying covariates, the
latter measured repeatedly over time, are often available. The inclusion
of covariates is a common strategy to improve parameter precision
(\citeproc{ref-boruvka2018}{Boruvka et al., 2018}) and address bias
introduced by (time-varying) confounders
(\citeproc{ref-daniel2013}{Daniel et al., 2013};
\citeproc{ref-Wodtke2020}{Wodtke, 2020}). Nevertheless, it is well-known
that this approach is not universally beneficial, as conditioning on
variables like colliders within the causal pathway can distort treatment
effect estimates (\citeproc{ref-elwert2014}{Elwert \& Winship, 2014}).

Dating back to the work of Pepe and Anderson (1994), it has also been
well-established that including endogenous time-varying
covariates---those directly or indirectly influenced by prior
exposure/treatment or outcome---in longitudinal studies without
treatment can result in biased estimates of treatment effects. Despite
its significance, this issue has received little attention in
psychological research. Building on this foundation, a recent paper by
Qian et al.~(2020) examined the suitability of MLM for estimating the
causal effect of a time-varying exposure or treatment. Specifically,
they focused on settings where the exposure is randomly assigned at each
occasion within individuals. Such randomized exposures may include, for
example, prompts delivered through push notifications to remind
participants of cognitive or mindfulness-based strategies
(\citeproc{ref-nahum-shani2021}{Nahum-Shani et al., 2021};
\citeproc{ref-walton2018}{Walton et al., 2018}). While random assignment
with a constant probability might seem sufficient to identify (the
presence and absence of) causal effects, Qian et al.
(\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{2020}) showed that model fitting issues and
parameter bias can arise when a \emph{time-varying endogenous covariate}
is present.

However, due to a divide between the disciplines that employ the MLM,
such critiques appear to have largely failed to reach the applied
researcher in psychology. One specific reason might be that the
technical jargon in other disciplines makes it difficult for researchers
to recognize when and how these issues emerge. Therefore, this report
aims to understand why Qian et al. (\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{2020}) found
biased estimates of the treatment effect for some generative models
containing endogenous covariates and not for others; and to explain this
issue to an audience of psychologists. To achieve this aim, the study
will first use graphical diagrams to evaluate relevant criteria,
ensuring accessibility and rigor through a reliance on graphical rules
rather than algebra. Next, data simulations, based on the original
scenarios of Qian et al. (\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{2020}) as well as
additional scenarios, will be conducted to pinpoint the issue and to
assess whether these criteria effectively identify bias. Accordingly,
the following research question will be addressed: \emph{When does the
inclusion of endogenous variables in multilevel linear models result in
biased estimates of the treatment effect?}

\section{Methods}\label{methods}

To obtain a better understanding of the issue exposed by Qian et al.
(\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{2020}), two methods were employed. First,
graphical methods were used provide insight into the presence and extent
of bias with potential violation of criteria: (a) path diagrams were
used to evaluate the conditional independence assumption
(\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{Qian et al., 2020}) and (b) directed acyclic
graphs (DAGs) were used to evaluate the backdoor criterion
(\citeproc{ref-pearl1988}{Pearl, 1988}, \citeproc{ref-pearl2009}{2009}).
Second, a simulation study was performed to reproduce the results for
the generative models (GMs) from Qian et al.
(\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{2020}) and to further isolate the issue using
additional GMs. In this simulation, bias in the treatment effect was
quantified using analytical multilevel models identical to the
generative models. In this section, the GMs will be formulated and
specifications will be defined for the simulation study.

\subsection{Data Generation}\label{data-generation}

We consider 2 GMs from Qian et al. (\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{2020}), one
(GM A) being a special case of the general model (GM G) where bias was
detected. To further isolate the source of bias, we introduce two
additional special cases, labeled GM B and C.
Table~\ref{tbl-gm-differences} summarizes the differences between the
generative models. Compared to the general model G, GM A is not directly
determined by the random intercept \(b_{i0}\); GM B is does not have a
random slope \(b_{i2}\) for treatment; and GM C does not have a fixed
interaction effect \(\beta_1\) between covariate and treatment.

The details of the generative models are described below. We follow the
symbol notation of Qian et al. (\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{2020}) to allow
for direct comparison, but rewrite the equations into within- and
between-person models (see \citeproc{ref-raudenbush2002}{Raudenbush \&
Bryk, 2002}; \citeproc{ref-Schoot2017}{Schoot, 2017}).

\subsubsection{Generative Model G}\label{generative-model-g}

Following the original notation of Qian et al.
(\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{2020}), the outcome of GM G was generated
according to the following model:

\[
Y_{it+1} = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 X_{it} + b_{i0} + A_{it} (\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{it} + b_{i2}) + \epsilon_{it+1}
\]

where \(Y_{it+1}\) is the outcome at time \(t+1\), \(X_{it}\) is the
covariate at time \(t\), \(A_{it}\) is the treatment at time \(t\),
\(b_{i0}\) is the random intercept, \(b_{i2}\) is the random slope for
the treatment, and \(\epsilon_{it+1}\) is the error term. We may rewrite
this model into the repeated-observations or within-person model in the
following steps:

\[ 
\begin{aligned} Y_{it+1} &= \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 X_{it} + b_{i0} + A_{it} (\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{it} + b_{i2}) + \epsilon_{it+1} \\ &= \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 X_{it} + b_{i0} + \beta_0 A_{it} +  \beta_1 A_{it} X_{it} + A_{it} b_{i2} + \epsilon_{it+1} \\ &= \alpha_0 + b_{i0} + \alpha_1 X_{it} + \beta_0 A_{it} + A_{it} b_{i2} + \beta_1 A_{it} X_{it} + \epsilon_{it+1} \\ &= (\alpha_0 + b_{i0}) + \alpha_1 X_{it} + (\beta_0 + b_{i2}) A_{it} + \beta_1 A_{it} X_{it} + \epsilon_{it+1} \\ &= \pi_{0i} + \pi_{1i} X_{it} + \pi_{2i} A_{it} + \pi_{3i} A_{it} X_{it} + \epsilon_{it+1}. \end{aligned}
\]

with the person-level or between-person model (level 2):

\[
\begin{aligned}
\pi_{0i} &= \alpha_0 + b_{i0}, & \text{where} \quad b_{i0} &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{b0}^2), \\
\pi_{1i} &= \alpha_1, \\
\pi_{2i} &= \beta_0 + b_{i2}, & \text{where} \quad b_{i2} &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{b2}^2), \\
\pi_{3i} &= \beta_1.
\end{aligned}
\]

We model fixed effects \(\alpha_0\), \(\alpha_1\), \(\beta_0\), and
\(\beta_1\) as constants across individuals, while random effects
\(b_{i0}\) and \(b_{i2}\) capture individual-specific deviations. The
presence of the interaction term \(\beta_1\) implies treatment
heterogeneity: the effect of the treatment \(A_{it}\) on the outcome
depends on the value of the covariate \(X_{it}\). \(b_{i0}\) represents
deviations from the population intercept \(\alpha_0\), and \(b_{i2}\)
represents deviations from the population slope \(\beta_0\). A higher
\(b_{i0}\) indicates a higher initial outcome, while a higher \(b_{i2}\)
indicates a stronger treatment effect. Following Qian et al.
(\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{2020}), the random effects \(b_{i0}\) and
\(b_{i2}\) are modeled independent of each other.

The covariate is generated as:

\[
X_{it} = 
\begin{cases} 
b_{i0} + \epsilon_{X_{it}}, & \text{if } t = 1, \\
b_{i0} + Y_{it} + \epsilon_{X_{it}}, & \text{if } t \geq 2,
\end{cases}
\quad \text{where} \quad \epsilon_{X_{it}} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)
\]

The randomization probability of treatment
\(p_t = P(A_{it} = 1 \mid H_{it})\) is constant at \(1/2\). Thus,
\(A_{it} \sim \text{Bernoulli}(0.5)\) for \(i = 1, \ldots, N\) and
\(t = 1, \ldots, T\). In other words, for every given person \(i\) and
every timepoint \(t\), the probability that treatment is assigned is
equivalent to a fair coinflip. The exogenous noise is
\(\epsilon_{it+1} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_\epsilon^2)\).

Figure~\ref{fig-GMG_path} shows the path diagram for the first couple
observations of GM G.

\subsubsection{Generative Model A}\label{generative-model-a}

GM A is a special case of GM G, where the effect of the random intercept
\(b_{i0}\) on the covariate \(X_{it}\) is set to zero. This results in a
model where the covariate \(X_{it}\) is not directly determined by the
random intercept \(b_{i0}\) (see Figure~\ref{fig-GMA_path}). Instead,
the endogenous covariate \(X_{it}\) equals the previous outcome
\(Y_{it}\) plus some random noise:

\[
X_{it} = 
\begin{cases} 
\epsilon_{X_{it}}, & \text{if } t = 1, \\
Y_{it} + \epsilon_{X_{it}}, & \text{if } t \geq 2,
\end{cases}
\quad \text{where} \quad \epsilon_{X_{it}} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)
\]

\subsubsection{Generative Model B}\label{generative-model-b}

GM B is a special case of GM G, where the variance for the random slope
\(b_{i2}\) is set to zero: \(\sigma_{b2}^2\) = 0. Consequently, the
random slope \(b_{i2}\) for the treatment \(A_{it}\) is removed (see
Figure~\ref{fig-GMB_path}). While the within-person model is the same as
GM G, there is a slight alteration in the between-person model:

\[ \pi_{2i} = \beta_0. \]

The single equation model then becomes:

\[
Y_{it+1} = (\alpha_0 + b_{i0}) + \alpha_1 X_{it} + \beta_0 A_{it} + \beta_1 A_{it} X_{it} + \epsilon_{it+1}
\]

\subsubsection{Generative Model C}\label{generative-model-c}

GM C is a special case of GM G, where the fixed interaction parameter
\(\beta_1 = 0\), which implies the removal of the interaction term
\(\beta_1 A_{it} X_{it}\) (see Figure~\ref{fig-GMC_path}). This, in
turn, removed \(\pi_{3i}\), thereby creating a discrepancy in
within-person model of GM C and GM G:

\[Y_{it+1} = \pi_{0i} + \pi_{1i} X_{it} + \pi_{2i} A_{it} + \epsilon_{it+1}.\]

Nevertheless, the between-person model of \(\pi_{0i}\), \(\pi_{1i}\) and
\(\pi_{2i}\) remains the same as GM G. The single equation model then
becomes:

\[
Y_{it+1} = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 X_{it} + b_{i0} + A_{it} (\beta_0 + b_{i2}) + \epsilon_{it+1}.
\]

\subsubsection{Parameter Values}\label{parameter-values}

The following parameter values were adapted from Qian et al.
(\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{2020}):

\[
\alpha_0 = -2, \quad \alpha_1 = -0.3, \quad \beta_0 = 1, \quad \beta_1 = 0.3,
\]

\[
\sigma_{b0}^2 = 4, \quad \sigma_{b2}^2 = 1, \quad \sigma_\epsilon^2 = 1.
\]

\subsection{Data Analysis}\label{data-analysis}

In the simulation study, we evaluated the performance of the models
across a total of 24 different settings, each replicated 1,000 times, by
systematically varying the following factors:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Generative Models (GM):} G, A, B, C
\item
  \textbf{Number of timepoints (T):} 10, 30
\item
  \textbf{Sample size (N):} 30, 100, 200
\end{itemize}

All data generation and estimation was performed in \texttt{R}, version
4.4.2 (\citeproc{ref-rcoreteam2024}{Team, 2024}). After the generation
of data generation for any given setting, analytical multilevel linear
models were fit that are equivalent to each of the respective
data-generating models. To fit the standard MLM, the \texttt{lmer}
function from the R-package \texttt{lme4}
(\citeproc{ref-bates2015}{Bates et al., 2015}) was employed with
restricted maximum likelihood estimation.

\section{Results}\label{results}

\subsection{Conditional Independence and Path
Diagrams}\label{conditional-independence-and-path-diagrams}

The first criterion for evaluating the presence of bias in treatment
effect estimates is the \emph{conditional independence assumption},
introduced by Qian et al. (\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{2020}) and based on
the work of Sitlani et al. (\citeproc{ref-sitlani2012}{2012}). According
to Qian et al. (\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{2020}), this assumption should
identify whether estimators of the treatment effect are consistent and
unbiased under randomized treatment assignment. The conditional
independence assumption states that the covariate at time \(t\)
(\(X_{it}\)) should be independent of the individual's random effects
(\(b_{i0}\) and \(b_{i1}\)) once we account for their history of
covariates (\(H_{it-1}\)), previous treatments (\(A_{it-1}\)), and prior
outcomes (\(Y_{it}\)). This is implied from the following notation:

\[ 
X_{it} \perp (b_{i0}, b_{i1}) \mid H_{it-1}, A_{it-1}, Y_{it}.
\]

where \(b_{i0}\) and \(b_{i1}\) represent the random intercept and
random slope(s), respectively, and \(H_{it-1}\) comprises all
observations of that covariate before timepoint \(t\). This assumption
allows for \(X_{it}\) to be influenced by earlier variables (e.g.,
outcomes or treatments) but not directly by unobserved individual
characteristics (i.e., random effects). If the included endogenous
covariates are only affected by prior outcomes and treatments, the
assumption is automatically satisfied. However, as Qian et al.
(\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{2020}) highlights, ensuring this assumption
holds requires careful consideration of theory and domain knowledge.

To clarify the application of the conditional independence assumption,
we pair the equations of the generative models (GMs) with path diagrams
(\citeproc{ref-duncan1966}{Duncan, 1966};
\citeproc{ref-wright1934a}{Wright, 1934}) illustrating the first three
timepoints (\(t\)) for each model (see Figure~\ref{fig-Pathdiagrams}).

Let's begin with the general model, GM G (Figure~\ref{fig-GMG_path}),
which Qian et al. (\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{2020}) identified as prone to
bias. In GM G, the covariate \(X_{it}\) is directly influenced by
unobserved individual factors (represented by the random effects,
\(b_{i0}\)). Consequently, conditioning on prior variables, such as the
outcome at the previous timepoint \(Y_{it}\), does not fully block or
eliminate the influence of these unobserved factors. As a result,
\(X_{it}\) remains dependent on the random effects, violating the
assumption that \(X_{it}\) should be independent of these unobserved
factors once we account for prior variables. This violation of the
conditional independence assumption explains the biased estimates of the
treatment effect observed in GM G, as identified by Qian et al.
(\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{2020}).

In contrast, GM A, a special case of GM G where no bias was found by
Qian et al. (\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{2020}), removes the direct link
between \(X_{it}\) and the random effects \(b_{i0}\). In this case,
\(X_{it}\) is simply the previous outcome \(Y_{it}\) plus some random
noise. While there remains an indirect connection between \(X_{it}\) and
\(b_{i0}\) through \(Y_{it}\), conditioning on \(Y_{it}\) effectively
``breaks the link'' between \(X_{it}\) and the random effects,
satisfying the conditional independence assumption. This explains the
unbiased treatment effect estimates found by Qian et al.
(\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{2020}).

For the additional special cases, GM B and GM C, the direct link between
the random effects and \(X_{it}\) remains, as in GM G. As a result,
these models also violate the conditional independence assumption,
leading to biased estimates of the treatment effect.

In summary, GM G, B, and C violate the conditional independence
assumption, which suggests that we would expect biased treatment effect
estimates for these models. In contrast, GM A satisfies the assumption,
supporting unbiased estimates of the treatment effect.

\subsection{Backdoor Criterion and
DAGs}\label{backdoor-criterion-and-dags}

The second criterion for evaluating the presence of bias in treatment
effect estimates is the \emph{backdoor criterion}
(\citeproc{ref-pearl1988}{Pearl, 1988}, \citeproc{ref-pearl2009}{2009}).
This criterion provides a partial solution to the classical problem in
causal inference: \emph{causal effects} cannot be directly observed and
must instead be inferred from observed associations, which often
represent a mixture of causal effects and various undesirable
non-causal, or \emph{spurious}, components
(\citeproc{ref-Holland1986}{Holland, 1986}). When it is possible, under
ideal conditions (e.g., no measurement error, infinite sample size), to
isolate the causal effect from a combination of causal and spurious
components, the causal effect is said to be identified. According to the
backdoor criterion (\citeproc{ref-pearl1988}{Pearl, 1988},
\citeproc{ref-pearl2009}{2009}), causal effects can be identified by
blocking non-causal paths through conditioning on appropriate variables
(e.g., controlling or matching). For instance, a causal effect of
exposure on outcome can be identified by including in the analysis
(i.e., controlling for) all relevant confounders---common causes that
would otherwise induce spurious relationships. However, if spurious
paths remain unblocked due to unmeasured variables or measurement error,
the treatment and outcome remain linked via backdoor paths, leading to
biased estimates of the treatment effect (\citeproc{ref-Kim2021a}{Kim \&
Steiner, 2021}).

To detect the presence of such backdoor paths, directed acyclic graphs
(DAGs) (\citeproc{ref-pearl1995}{Pearl, 1995},
\citeproc{ref-pearl2009}{2009}) are invaluable tools. DAGs generalize
conventional linear path diagrams (\citeproc{ref-duncan1966}{Duncan,
1966}; \citeproc{ref-wright1934a}{Wright, 1934}) and operate in a fully
nonparametric framework. Unlike traditional path diagrams, DAGs make no
assumptions about distributional properties (e.g., multivariate
normality) or functional forms (e.g., linearity). Instead, they encode
qualitative causal assumptions about the data-generating process in the
population. Arrows connecting nodes indicate direct causal effects,
which may vary in magnitude across individuals (effect heterogeneity) or
depend on the values of other variables (effect interaction or
modification) (\citeproc{ref-elwert2014}{Elwert \& Winship, 2014}).
Notably, random slopes from random-effects models and interaction
effects are not explicitly represented in DAGs, which precludes their
use for evaluating the conditional independence assumption.

Using the direct causal effects specified in each generative model (GM),
we can formulate DAGs for the first three observations, representing the
random disturbance \(b_{0i}\) as the node \(U\) (e.g.,
\citeproc{ref-Kim2021a}{Kim \& Steiner, 2021}, see
Figure~\ref{fig-DAGs}). These diagrams confirm that random slopes and
fixed interaction effects are absent. Indeed, this absence explains why
the DAGs for GMs G, B, and C are equivalent.

\begin{figure}[H]

1, 2, 3)}

\end{minipage}%

\end{figure}%

\emph{Note.} The red arrows show the biased backdoor path(s) in the
treatment efffect (before controlling for \(X_{it}\)).

\vspace{2em}

We now apply the backdoor criterion to these DAGs to assess potential
bias in the treatment effect. For all GMs, there are no backdoor paths
in the treatment effect \(A_t \to Y_{t+1}\), as \(A_t\) lacks any parent
nodes. Consequently, covariate \(X_t\) need not be controlled to obtain
an unbiased total effect. Importantly, including \(X_{it}\) does not
introduce identification issues, as it is neither a mediator (i.e., on
the pathway from \(A_t\) to \(Y_{t+1}\)) nor a collider (i.e., a common
effect of \(A_t\) and \(Y_{t+1}\)). Therefore, according to the backdoor
criterion, controlling for \(X_{it}\) should not result in biased
estimates of the treatment effect in any of the generative models.

\subsection{Simulation Study}\label{simulation-study}

Table~\ref{tbl-simulation-results} and
Figure~\ref{fig-simulation-results} present the simulation results for
each of the generative models. The \(\beta_0\) bias in
Table~\ref{tbl-simulation-results} refers to
\(\bar{\hat{\beta}}_{0} - \beta_{0}\), representing the difference
between the mean of the estimated parameter values
\(\bar{\hat{\beta}}_{0}\) and the prespecified treatment effect
\(\beta_{0} = 1\). Thus, an absolute bias of 0.05 implies a \(5\%\)
relative bias.

In this reproduction of Qian et al. (\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{2020}), the
overall pattern was consistent with the original study (see
Figure~\ref{fig-simulation-results}): we observed substantial absolute
bias ranging from \(0.023\) (\(2.3\%\)) to \(0.064\) (\(6.4\%\)) for the
most general generative model (GM G), and much smaller bias of
\(\leq 0.015\) (\(1.5\%\)) for GM A. These results align with
expectations based on the conditional independence assumption, which
predicts that the treatment effect would be unbiased for GM A and biased
for GM G. However, the findings contradict the backdoor criterion, which
predicts no bias for any of the generative models (GMs). Notably, we
found 4 times greater treatment effect bias for GM A in the scenario
with \(T = 10\) and \(N = 100\) than reported by Qian et al.
(\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{2020}), with a maximum bias of \(-0.012\)
(\(1.2\%\); (see Table~\ref{tbl-simulation-results}), compared to
\(-0.003\) (\(0.3\%\)) found by Qian et al.
(\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{2020}). For GM G, the size of the bias
decreased as the number of time points increased.

For the two additional special cases of GM G, namely GM B and GM C, we
observed even smaller absolute bias than for GM A: \(\leq 0.010\)
(\(1\%\)) for GM C and \(\leq 0.005\) (\(0.5\%\)) for GM B (see
Table~\ref{tbl-simulation-results}). These findings align with the
backdoor criterion's prediction of no bias but contradict the
expectations based on the conditional independence assumption, which
suggests the presence of bias. Additionally, GM B exhibited the smallest
absolute bias overall and showed much smaller variability across
simulation replications compared to all other GMs. In contrast, the
remaining models exhibited comparable levels of variability (see
Figure~\ref{fig-simulation-results} and
Table~\ref{tbl-simulation-results}).

In summary, these findings suggest that once we modify the most general
model G by removing either the dependency of the random intercept on the
covariate (GM A), the random slope \(b_{i2}\) (GM B), or the interaction
term \(\beta_1\) (GM C), the bias either disappears or becomes
negligible. However, neither the backdoor criterion nor the conditional
independence assumption provided consistent predictions of treatment
effect bias across all models.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}

In this research report, we evaluated several GMs to investigate when
endogenous time-varying covariates bias treatment effect estimates in
multilevel linear models (MLMs) under randomized treatment. We also
assessed the ability of the conditional independence assumption and the
backdoor criterion to predict this bias. Consistent with Qian et al.
(\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{2020}) and the conditional independence
assumption, we observed substantially greater bias in the most general
model (GM G) compared to a special case (GM A), where the direct effect
of the random intercept on the covariate was removed. However, one
unexpected result was the fourfold increase in maximum bias for GM A
compared to Qian et al. (\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{2020}). This
discrepancy may stem from differences in the simulation setup (e.g.,
random number generation or handling of warnings/errors). The two
additional special cases of GM G, where the random slope for treatment
(GM B) or the interaction term between treatment and covariate (GM C)
was removed, exhibited even smaller bias in the treatment
effect---despite violations of the conditional independence assumption.

These findings tell us that---at least in this particular instance---the
dependency between covariate and treatment, the random slope for
treatment and the interaction effect are all essential for the absolute
bias to exceed the \(5\%\). Following this, the question naturally
arises why no discernable bias was present in the additional special
cases of the general model, as was suggested by the conditional
independence assumption; and whether this pattern generalizes or is
limited to the current generative models. One possible general
explanation could be that, as predicted by the conditional independence
assumption, bias was present in one or both scenarios, but that---in the
current GMs---it was cancelled out by the removal of a parameter.
Conversely, it could also be argued that some form of heterogeneity in
the treatment effect---either unexplained through the random slope or
explained through the covariate---is necessary for the bias to occur.
While Qian et al. (\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{2020}) mentions that applying
the MLM can be problematic because \emph{moderators} of the treatment
effect may be endogenous, it may be that the covariate being a moderator
in the treatment effect is a prerequisite for bias. This could explain
why no discernable bias was found for the special case without an
interaction term between treatment and covariate (GM C) and why the
conditional independence assumption failed to predict this bias.
However, if this were the case, it would be strange that Qian et al.
(\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{2020}) does not state this requirement
explicitly. Future research is needed to establish whether this pattern
is an anomaly or generalizes, so that practical recommendations can be
formulated with regard to the use of multilevel linear models in the
presence of endogenous covariates. Furthermore, additional research is
also needed to further explore this issue and establish why the added
heterogeneity in the treatment effect may be necessary for bias to
occur.

Concerning the backdoor criterion and DAG
(\citeproc{ref-pearl1988}{Pearl, 1988}, \citeproc{ref-pearl2009}{2009}),
we found that the classical non-parametric DAG may not be sufficient to
identify bias in the treatment effect for GM G, as its arrows indicate
direct causal effects that may vary in size across individuals or depend
on the values of other variables. As a result, the DAG does not impose
restrictions based on random slopes and interaction effects, thereby
being excluded from being useful in considering the conditional
independence assumption, which contains specific restrictions based on
random slope(s). Concerns regarding the use of Pearl's backdoor
criterion in situations with interaction effects\footnote{Note that the
  term ``effect modification'', while often used interchangeably with
  ``interaction'', has a distinct definition in the counterfactual
  framework (\citeproc{ref-vanderweele2009}{VanderWeele, 2009}).} have
been voiced by several people (see Weinberg
(\citeproc{ref-weinberg2007}{2007}); Attia et al.
(\citeproc{ref-attia2022}{2022})). Future research could explore to what
extent proposed extensions of the DAG---that include interaction
effects---may be useful in identifying bias in the treatment effect for
generative models.

It should also be noted that the current investigation takes for granted
that estimators of the MLM may not be marginal estimators, but instead
conditional-on-the-random-effect estimators, as argued by . This is a
common assumption in the social sciences, where the focus is often on
the person-specific interpretation of the parameters. However, the
marginal interpretation of the parameters may be of interest in other
fields, such as epidemiology, where the focus is on the population
average effect. When we aim to estimate the average causal effect of a
treatment, we may be more interested in the marginal interpretation of
the parameters . Future work is needed to fully incorperate the
literature on marginal effects and causal inference into the current
issue.

It would also be interesting to see how treatment effect bias would be
affected by centering approaches (see Hamaker \& Muth√©n
(\citeproc{ref-hamaker2020}{2020})). Antonakis et al.
(\citeproc{ref-antonakis2021}{2021}) notes that the assumption of
uncorrelatedness between the random effects and level 1 covariates can
be relaxed by using Mundlak's contextual model\footnote{This is referred
  to as the Correlated Random Effects (CRE) approach by Wooldridge
  (\citeproc{ref-wooldridge2002}{2002}).}
(\citeproc{ref-mundlak1978}{Mundlak, 1978}): adding the cluster means of
each covariate as predictor of the random intercept. As argued by Bell
\& Jones (\citeproc{ref-bell2015}{2015}), the source of endogeneity is
often interesting and worthy of explicit modelling. Hence, it would be
interesting to see how this affects the treatment effect bias of GM G.

The study by Qian et al. (\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{2020}) only considered
a situation with uncorrelated random effects, which may be restrictive
and often violated in practice. Thus, another interesting avenue for
future research would be to investigate what would happen if the random
effects were correlated, which is possible in the structural equation
modeling format (\citeproc{ref-rovine2000}{Rovine \& Molenaar, 2000}).
Following this, we could

It may be interesting to investigate the implications of endogenous
covariates in MLMs for other types of longitudinal data analysis
methods, such as dynamic structural equation modelling (DSEM; a widely
used framework in the social sciences based on MLM).

\subsection{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

This report is a first step towards understanding the implications of
endogenous covariates in multilevel linear models. However, to recognize
and understand completely when and why endogenous covariates may trouble
an empirical investigation, further research is needed.
