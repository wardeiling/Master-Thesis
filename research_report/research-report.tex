\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Across a wide range of disciplines, researchers analyze clustered
longitudinal, observational data to investigate prospective causal
relationships between variables. When analyzing such data, the
psychological sciences most commonly resort to the multilevel linear
model (MLM, \citeproc{ref-mcneish2017}{McNeish et al., 2017}),
which---in the context of longitudinal data analysis---separates
observed variance into stable between-person differences and
within-person fluctuations (\citeproc{ref-hamaker2020}{Hamaker \&
Muth√©n, 2020}). Conversely, other fields, such as biostatistics and
econometrics often favour generalized estimating equations (GEE) for the
analysis of longitudinal data (\citeproc{ref-mcneish2017}{McNeish et
al., 2017}). Despite some cross-disciplinary efforts to compare these
methods (\citeproc{ref-mcneish2017}{McNeish et al., 2017};
\citeproc{ref-muth2016}{Muth et al., 2016}; \citeproc{ref-yan2013}{Yan
et al., 2013}), their scarcity may leave researchers with limited
guidance in choosing the most suitable approach for their application.

A recent study by Qian et al. (\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{2020})
highlighted an issue present in both methods---except for GEE with
working independence---where controlling for \emph{time-varying
endogenous covariates} may lead to biased causal estimates. A
time-varying covariate is \emph{endogenous} if it is directly or
indirectly influenced by prior treatment or outcome, meaning its value
may be determined by earlier stages of the process
(\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{Qian et al., 2020}).
Figure~\ref{fig-endogenous-example} showcases a simple multilevel linear
model, with a random intercept \(b_{0i}\) and an endogenous covariate
\(X_{it}\).

\begin{figure}[H]

(\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{2020}).

\end{figure}%

As a result of including these covariates in these models, ordinary
interpretations of the coefficients are no longer valid
(\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{Qian et al., 2020, p. 3}). According to Diggle
(\citeproc{ref-diggle2002}{2002}), this issue not only pertains GEE and
MLM, but \emph{all} longitudinal data analysis methods.

The issue described in Qian et al. (\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{2020}) can
be

However, due to a divide between the disciplines that employ these
methods, such critiques of the MLM appear to have largely failed to
reach the applied researcher in psychology. One specific reason might be
that the technical jargon in other disciplines makes it difficult for
researchers to recognize when and how these issues emerge\footnote{For
  instance, the term `endogeneity' in econometrics, while related, has a
  distinct meaning from that of an endogenous variable, which can lead
  to confusion.}. Therefore, this report aims to understand and explain
the issue of including endogenous covariates in analyses involving GEE
and MLM in a psychological context. To achieve this aim, the current
investigation will employ (a) graphical tools such as the directed
acyclic graph (DAG) and path diagram to assess causal identification
assumptions, as well as (b) simulations with additional scenarios to
pinpoint the issue.

Accordingly, the following research questions will be addressed with
sub-questions being specified to isolate the issue described in the Qian
et al. (\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{2020}):

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  When does the inclusion of endogenous variables in multilevel linear
  models result in biased estimates of the treatment effect?

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{(\alph{enumii})}
  \item
    How is the bias in the treatment effect affected by the removal of
    the interaction \(\beta_1\) from generative model 3?
  \item
    How is the bias in the treatment effect affected by the removal of
    the random slope \(b_{i2}\) from generative model 3?
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  When does the inclusion of of endogenous covariates in multilevel
  linear models result in a discrepancy between conditional and marginal
  interpretations of the treatment effect?
\end{enumerate}

Research questions 1 and 2 will be investigated by employing MLM and GEE
estimation respectively.

\newpage

\section{Methods}\label{methods}

To obtain a better understanding of the issue exposed by Qian et al.
(\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{2020}), two methods were employed. First,
graphical methods were used provide insight into the presence and extent
of bias with potential violation of assumptions: (a) path diagrams were
used to evaluate the conditional independence assumption and (b)
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) were used to evaluate the backdoor
criterion (Pearl, 1988, 2009). Second, a simulation study was performed
to reproduce the results for the generative models (GMs) from Qian et
al. (\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{2020}) and to further isolate the issue
using additional GMs.

\subsection{Data Generation}\label{data-generation}

In the simulation Qian et al. (\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{2020}) considered
three generative models (GMs), all of which have an endogenous
time-varying covariate. In GM1 and GM2, the endogenous covariate
\(X_{it}\) equals the previous outcome \(Y_{it}\) plus some random
noise, so the \emph{conditional independence} assumption is valid. In
GM3, the endogenous covariate depends directly on \(b_{i0}\), violating
the assumption. To isolate the issue in GM3, we consider two variations
on this model: GM3A, where the random slope \(b_{i2}\) for the treatment
\(A_{it}\) is removed; GM3B, where the interaction term
\(\beta_1 A_{it} X_{it}\) is removed. Note that the conditional
independence assumption is violated in either of these variations. The
details of the generative models are described below. We follow the
notation of Qian et al. (\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{2020}) to allow for
direct comparison, but rewrite the equations into within- and
between-person models (see \citeproc{ref-raudenbush2002}{Raudenbush \&
Bryk, 2002}). We accompany the equations of the GMs with graphical
representations, where random effects are represented by grey circles,
observed variables by squares and relationships across variables by
arrows. The path diagrams of the three data generating models shows the
discrepancies between the different generative models---especially
concerning the interaction effects---more clearly than DAGs.

\subsubsection{Generative Model 1}\label{generative-model-1}

In GM1, we considered a simple case with only a random intercept and a
random slope for \(X_{it}\). The outcome is generated according to the
following repeated-observations or within-person model (level 1):

\[
Y_{it+1} = \pi_{0i} + \pi_{1i} X_{it} + \pi_{2i} A_{it} + \pi_{3i} A_{it} X_{it} + \epsilon_{it+1}
\]

with the person-level or between-person model (level 2):

\[
\pi_{0i} = \alpha_0 + b_{i0}, \quad b_{i0} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{b0}^2),
\]

\[
\pi_{1i} = \alpha_1,
\]

\[
\pi_{2i} = \beta_0 + b_{i2}, \quad b_{i2} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{b2}^2),
\]

\[
\pi_{3i} = \beta_1.
\]

By substitution, we get the single equation model:

\[
\begin{aligned}
Y_{it+1} &= \pi_{0i} + \pi_{1i} X_{it} + \pi_{2i} A_{it} + \pi_{3i} A_{it} X_{it} + \epsilon_{it+1} \\
&= (\alpha_0 + b_{i0}) + \alpha_1 X_{it} + (\beta_0 + b_{i2}) A_{it} + \beta_1 A_{it} X_{it} + \epsilon_{it+1} \\
&= \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 X_{it} + b_{i0} + A_{it} (\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{it} + b_{i2}) + \epsilon_{it+1}.
\end{aligned}
\]

The random effects \(b_{i0} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{b0}^2)\) and
\(b_{i2} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{b2}^2)\) are independent of each
other. The covariate is generated as \(X_{i1} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)\),
and for \(t \geq 2\),

\[
X_{it} = Y_{it} + \mathcal{N}(0, 1).
\]

The randomization probability \(p_t = P(A_{it} = 1 \mid H_{it})\) is
constant at \(1/2\). Thus, \(A_{it} \sim \text{Bernoulli}(0.5)\) for
\(i = 1, \ldots, N\) and \(t = 1, \ldots, T\). The exogenous noise is
\(\epsilon_{it+1} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_\epsilon^2)\).

Figure~\ref{fig-GM1_path} shows the path diagram for GM1.

\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{\label{fig-GM1_path}Path diagram for Generative Model 1
(\(t = 1, 2, 3\))}

\centering{

\includegraphics{research-report_files/figure-pdf/fig-GM1_path-1.pdf}

}

\end{figure}%

\subsubsection{Generative Model 2}\label{generative-model-2}

In GM2, we considered the case with a random intercept and random slopes
for (1) covariate \(X_{it}\), (2) treatment \(A_{it}\), and (3) the
interaction between \(A_{it}\) and \(X_{it}\); and with a time-varying
randomization probability for treatment. The outcome is generated
according to the same repeated-observations model presented in GM1.
However, the person-level model is different:

\[
\pi_{0i} = \alpha_0 + b_{i0}, \quad b_{i0} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{b0}^2),
\]

\[
\pi_{1i} = \alpha_1 + b_{i1}, \quad b_{i1} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{b1}^2),
\]

\[
\pi_{2i} = \beta_0 + b_{i2}, \quad b_{i2} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{b2}^2),
\]

\[
\pi_{3i} = \beta_1 + b_{i3}, \quad b_{i3} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{b3}^2).
\]

By substitution, we get the single equation model:

\[
\begin{aligned}
Y_{it+1} &= \pi_{0i} + \pi_{1i} X_{it} + \pi_{2i} A_{it} + \pi_{3i} A_{it} X_{it} + \epsilon_{it+1} \\ 
&= (\alpha_0 + b_{i0}) + (\alpha_1 + b_{i1}) X_{it} + (\beta_0 + b_{i2}) A_{it} + (\beta_1 + b_{i3}) A_{it} X_{it} + \epsilon_{it+1} \\ 
&= \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 X_{it} + b_{i0} + b_{i1} X_{it} + A_{it} \left( \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{it} + b_{i2} + b_{i3} X_{it} \right) + \epsilon_{it+1}.
\end{aligned}
\]

The random effects \(b_{ij} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{bj}^2)\), for
\(j = 0, 1, 2, 3\), are independent of each other. The covariate is
generated as \(X_{i1} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)\), and for \(t \geq 2\),

\[
X_{it} = Y_{it} + \mathcal{N}(0, 1).
\]

The randomization probability depends on \(X_{it}\):

\[
p_t = P(A_{it} = 1 \mid H_{it}) = 
\begin{cases} 
0.7 & \text{if } X_{it} > -1.27, \\
0.3 & \text{if } X_{it} \leq -1.27,
\end{cases}
\]

where the cutoff \(-1.27\) was chosen so that \(p_t\) equals 0.7 or 0.3
for about half of the time. In other words, if the value of the
covariate for any given person and time point is above the cutoff, the
probability of receiving the treatment \(p_t\) is 0.7; otherwise, it is
0.3. Accordingly, \(A_{it} \sim \text{Bernoulli}(p_t)\) for
\(i = 1, \ldots, N\) and \(t = 1, \ldots, T\). The exogenous noise is
\(\epsilon_{it+1} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_\epsilon^2)\).

Figure~\ref{fig-GM2_path} shows the path diagram for GM2.

}

\end{figure}%

\subsubsection{Generative Model 3}\label{generative-model-3}

GM3 is the same as GM1, except that the covariate \(X_{it}\) depends
directly on \(b_{i0}\):

\[
X_{i1} \sim \mathcal{N}(b_{i0}, 1), \quad X_{it} = Y_{it} + \mathcal{N}(b_{i0}, 1) \text{ for } t \geq 2.
\]

Figure~\ref{fig-GM3_path} shows the path diagram for GM3.

}

\end{figure}%

\subsubsection{Generative Model 3A}\label{generative-model-3a}

GM3A is the same as GM3, except that the random slope \(b_{i2}\) for the
treatment \(A_{it}\) is removed. The single equation model then becomes:

\[
Y_{it+1} = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 X_{it} + b_{i0} + A_{it} (\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{it}) + \epsilon_{it+1}.
\]

(\(t = 1, 2, 3\))}

}

\end{figure}%

\subsubsection{Generative Model 3B}\label{generative-model-3b}

GM3B is the same as GM3, except that the interaction term
\(\beta_1 A_{it} X_{it}\) is removed. The single equation model then
becomes:

\[
Y_{it+1} = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 X_{it} + b_{i0} + A_{it} (\beta_0 + b_{i2}) + \epsilon_{it+1}.
\]

(\(t = 1, 2, 3\))}

\centering{

\includegraphics{research-report_files/figure-pdf/fig-GM3B_path-1.pdf}

}

\end{figure}%

\subsubsection{Parameter Values}\label{parameter-values}

The following parameter values were adapted from Qian et al.
(\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{2020}):

\[
\alpha_0 = -2, \quad \alpha_1 = -0.3, \quad \beta_0 = 1, \quad \beta_1 = 0.3,
\]

\[
\sigma_{b0}^2 = 4, \quad \sigma_{b1}^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad \sigma_{b2}^2 = 1, \quad \sigma_{b3}^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad \sigma_\epsilon^2 = 1.
\]

\subsection{Path Diagrams and Conditional
Independence}\label{path-diagrams-and-conditional-independence}

Qian et al. (\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{2020}) proposes the use of the
conditional independence assumption to identify whether bias may occur,
which is given by:

\[ X_{it} \perp (b_{i0}, b_{i1}) \mid H_{it-1}, A_{it-1}, Y_{it}. \]

where \(H_{it-1}\) refers to the history of the set of covariates, which
in this case are all observations of covariate \(X_{it}\) prior to the
current timepoint \(t\). This allows \(X_{it}\) to be endogenous, but
the endogenous covariate \(X_{it}\) can only depend on the random
effects through variables observed prior to \(X_{it}\). If the only
endogenous covariates are functions of prior treatments and prior
outcomes, then the assumption automatically holds.

When inspecting Figure~\ref{fig-GM1_path} and Figure~\ref{fig-GM2_path},
we may notice that \(X_{it}\) becomes independent of the random effects
after conditioning on \(Y_{it}\). On the other hand, we can see that
this assumption is violated in GM3/3A/3B, as \(X_{it}\) depends directly
on \(b_{i0}\) and can thus not be made independent of the random effects
by conditioning on prior variables such as \(Y_{it}\) (see
Figure~\ref{fig-GM3_path}, Figure~\ref{fig-GM3A_path} and
Figure~\ref{fig-GM3B_path}). Thus, we would expect biased estimates of
the treatment effect for GM3/3A/3B.

\subsection{Backdoor Criterion and
DAGs}\label{backdoor-criterion-and-dags}

DAGs are a useful tool for representing causal relationships between
variables and to evaluate the assumptions needed for causal
identification. According to the backdoor criterion
(\citeproc{ref-pearl1988}{Pearl, 1988}, \citeproc{ref-pearl2009}{2009}),
a requirement for causal identification, causal effects can be
identified by blocking non-causal paths through conditioning on
intermediate variables (e.g., controlling or matching). If any
non-causal paths cannot be blocked due to omitted variables or
measurement error, treatment and outcome remain linked via backdoor
paths, leading to biased estimates of the treatment effect
(\citeproc{ref-Kim2021a}{Kim \& Steiner, 2021}).

We formulated the DAGs in \texttt{dagitty}, where the random disturbance
\(b_{0i}\) was represented by the node U (e.g.,
\citeproc{ref-Kim2021a}{Kim \& Steiner, 2021}). The DAGs for the first
three observations of the three data generating models are presented in
Figure~\ref{fig-DAGs}.

When applying Pearl's backdoor criterion to GM1/3/3A/3B, it may be
observed that there exists no backdoor path in the treatment effect
\(A_{it} \to Y_{it+1}\), as \(A_{it}\) does not have any parents. While
we need not control for covariate \(X_{it}\) to obtain an unbiased total
effect, doing so should not introduce bias.

On the other hand, in GM2, there is a backdoor path in the treatment
effect: \(A_{it} \leftarrow X_{it} \rightarrow Y_{it+1}\) (see
Figure~\ref{fig-GM2_DAG}). More specifically, \(X_{it}\) is a confounder
in the relationship between \(A_{it}\) and \(Y_{it+1}\). However,
controlling for \(X_{it}\) blocks this backdoor path, making the
treatment effect unbiased. In other words, the history of covariate
\(X_{it}\) is a sufficient adjustment set for the treatment effect.

All things considered, according to the backdoor criterion, controlling
for the covariate \(X_{it}\) should not result in biased estimates of
the treatment effect for any of the generative models.

\subsection{Data Analysis}\label{data-analysis}

We evaluated the performance of the models across a total of 30
different settings, each replicated 1,000 times, by systematically
varying the following factors:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Generative Models (GM):} 1, 2, 3, 3A, 3B
\item
  \textbf{Number of timepoints (T):} 10, 30
\item
  \textbf{Sample size (N):} 30, 100, 200
\end{itemize}

All data generation and estimation was performed in \texttt{R}, version
4.4.2 (\citeproc{ref-rcoreteam2024}{Team, 2024}). After the generation
of data generation for any given setting, several models were fit. To
fit the standard MLM, the \texttt{lmer} function from the R-package
\texttt{lme4} (\citeproc{ref-bates2015}{Bates et al., 2015}) was
employed with restricted maximum likelihood estimation. For the MLM, the
analytical models were equivalent to each of the respective
data-generating models. To fit the GEE with the ``exchangeable'',
``independent'' and ``AR(1)'' working correlation structures, the
\texttt{geeglm} function from the R-package \texttt{geepack}
(\citeproc{ref-halekoh2006}{Halekoh et al., 2006}) was employed with the
identity link function. Since the random effects are not explicitly
modelled in GEE, the analytical GEE models simply contain only the fixed
effects of the generative model at hand.

\section{Results}\label{results}

Table~\ref{tbl-simulation-results} presents the simulation results for
each of the generative and analytical models. The estimates for the
analytical MLM may be interpreted in terms of bias. Here we find that
there is little to no bias for GM1/2/3A/3B and substantial bias for GM3.
Thus, once we remove either the dependency of the random intercept with
the covariate (GM1), the random slope \(b_{i2}\) (GM3A) or the
interaction \(\beta_1\) (GM3B) from GM3, the bias dissapears or becomes
extremely small. The bias in GM3 decreases as the number of timepoints
\(T\) increases from 10 to 30. Note that the MLM model fitting success
rates are particularly poor for GM2, where in the worst case, only 87 of
the 1000 models were fitted.

For the GEE with independence, the values refer to the difference
between the estimated marginal effect---which should be unbiased under
endogenous covariates (see \citeproc{ref-pepe1994}{Pepe \& Anderson,
1994})---and the specified conditional effect. Here we find that there
is a enormous difference between these effects for GM2, which increases
along with an increase in \(T\) and \(N\), up to a difference of more
than 6,000. This is followed by a difference of around .07-.09 for GM1,
.02-.04 for GM3, \(\leq 0.015\) for GM3B and close to zero for GM3A. The
GEE models fitted succesfully for all settings.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}

This report employed both graphical methods and data simulations to
understand and explain the issue of endogenous covariates. Now we will
discuss the findings relating to the two research questions, while
excluding GM2 due to model fitting issues.

Using the conditional independence assumption of Qian et al.
(\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{2020}), we would expect, based on the path
diagrams, that the treatment effect would be biased for GM3, 3A and 3B.
On the other hand, the backdoor criterion suggested the absence of bias
for all generative models. While Qian et al.
(\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{2020}) show that GM3 is the only model with
bias in the treatment effect, the backdoor criterion failed to identify
this bias, as there is no backdoor path in the treatment effect. This
may be explained by the fact that the DAG does not impose restrictions
based on (a) the random slopes and (b) interaction effects. Concerns
regarding the use of Pearl's backdoor criterion in situations with
interaction effects have been voiced by several people (see Weinberg
(\citeproc{ref-weinberg2007}{2007}); Attia et al.
(\citeproc{ref-attia2022}{2022})).

The first research question---pertaining to the extent of treatment
effect bias in MLM estimates of generative model that were nested in
GM3---was investigated using the analytical multilevel model. First, we
reproduced the findings by Qian et al. (\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{2020})
that the estimators are consistent for GM1 and GM2, but inconsistent for
GM3. Using additional generative models, we found that bias became
indiscernable when removing from GM3 either the dependency between the
random intercept and covariate (GM1), the random slope for treatment
(GM3A) or the interaction effect (GM3B). This finding is in sharp
contrast to the suggestion of the conditional independence assumption
that the treatment effect would be biased for GM3, 3A and 3B.

The second research question---related to the discrepancy between
marginal and conditional interpretations of the treatment effect---was
assessed with analytical GEE with working independence. Here we found
extreme differences between the estimated marginal and specified
conditional effect for GM2, suggesting that the marginal interpretation
breaks down the most for this generative model\footnote{Note, however,
  that this generative model may not be plausible given the extreme
  spread across the covariate and treatment variables.}. Hence, for this
GM, a false interpretation of the MLM parameters as marginal, would
potentially have great inferential consequences. For GM1 and GM3, there
smaller but still noticeable differences between the marginal and
conditional effect. This suggests that the marginal interpretation of
the treatment effect may be recovered for GM3, 3A and 3B, but not for
GM2. Especially for GM3A, this difference was practically indescernable,
suggesting that the marginal interpretation of the treatment effect may
be recovered. Conversely, Qian et al. (\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{2020})
notes that if the random effect in the model does not interact with the
treatment variable, the interaction recovers its marginal interpretation
but the treatment effect does not (p.~382). This difference in
conclusions may be explained through the difference in approach: while
Qian et al. (\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{2020}) provides an analytical
answer, the current study provides approximations through simulations.

For the GM2 setting of Qian et al. (\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{2020}), we
found several issues, which were most pronounced for \(T = 30\). First,
we noticed extreme model fitting issues for the MLM, due to, among other
things, a lack of convergence and singularity. It should be noted that
unlike the script used here, Qian et al. (\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{2020})
deals only with errors of the \texttt{lmer()} function, but not with
warnings (e.g., pertaining to non-convergence) in their script. This
discrepancy may explain the slightly different estimates of MLM bias for
GM2. Second, we found extremely large GEE estimates of the treatment
effect. This may be explained by the fact that the values of the
covariate and outcome were also extremely great, often exceeding a
million. All things considered, this suggests that GM2 may be a poorly
specified model.

\section{Other ideas}\label{other-ideas}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Initially, it seemed that the issue of endogenous covariates meant
  that, for unbiased estimation of the treatment effect, we should rely
  on GEE with independence. However, it is important not to conflate the
  issues mentioned by Qian et al. (\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{2020}). The
  first issue pertains to model interpretation: should we expect
  covariates to be endogenous and be primarily interested in marginal
  interpretations of the parameters rather than the person-specific
  (conditional-on-the-random-effect) interpretation, we should indeed
  employ GEE with working independence (OR STRUCTURAL MARGINAL MODELS???
  CHECK THIS OUT IN ZOTERO). The second issue pertains to model fitting:
  once we conclude that person-specific interpretation aligns with our
  interest but we fear the presence of endogenous covariates, we have to
  assess the conditional independence assumption.
\item
  Across all generative model, we generally found that the estimated
  fixed treatment effect differed more from the specified MLM effect for
  the analytical GEE models than for the analytical MLM model. This is
  rather unsurprising, considering that the MLM is analyzing the exact
  same model as was specified, thereby putting it at an advantage over
  the GEE.
\item
  While GEE with independence may indeed yield unbiased estimators of
  the marginal effect as mentioned by Qian et al.
  (\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{2020}), they do not reflect the value of the
  model parameter. And since the endogeneity of a covariate implies that
  it is determined by the random effect, thereby making the marginal
  relationship between any given \(X_{it}\) and \(Y_{it+1}\) different
  as shown by Qian et al. (\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{2020}) (section 2.2),
  it is unclear what utility the combined marginal effect may serve in
  this context.
\item
  They set the same seed for every setting, potentially making the first
  dataset the same for every setting. Nevertheless, properly randomizing
  does not seem to drastically impact the results. The settings with
  GM2, \(T = 30\) and \(N \geq 100\) of Qian et al.
  (\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{2020}) results in very implausible values for
  the covariate \(X_{it}\) and outcome \(Y_{it+1}\), often exceeding a
  million. This may imply the presence of a non-stationary process
  (e.g., unit root). In the case of GEE analytical models, these
  settings result in very large estimates.
\item
  wasn't working exchangeability in GEE equivalent to MLM? then use this
  to argue why using this GEE variation. Because for the difference of
  GEE with independence from the actual specified conditional parameter
  estimates should indicate a difference between the marginal and
  conditional effect, but this is not bias. Can we speak of bias with
  exchangeability?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    no it depends on the random effects, and it was compound symmetry.
    Leave this for next time.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Appendix}\label{appendix}

\subsection{Original Section from Qian et al.~(2020): ``4.
Simulation''}\label{original-section-from-qian-et-al.-2020-4.-simulation}

In the simulation, we considered three generative models (GMs), all of
which have an endogenous covariate. In the first two GMs, the endogenous
covariate \(X_{it}\) equals the previous outcome \(Y_{it}\) plus some
random noise, so the conditional independence assumption (10) is valid.
In GM 3, the endogenous covariate depends directly on \(b_i\), violating
assumption (10). The details of the generative models are described
below.

In GM1, we considered a simple case with only a random intercept and a
random slope for \(A_{it}\), so that \(Z_{i(t_0)} = Z_{i(t_2)} = 1\) in
model (7). The outcome is generated as:

\[
Y_{it+1} = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 X_{it} + b_{i0} + A_{it} (\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{it} + b_{i2}) + \epsilon_{it+1}.
\]

The random effects \(b_{i0} \sim N(0, \sigma_{b0}^2)\) and
\(b_{i2} \sim N(0, \sigma_{b2}^2)\) are independent of each other. The
covariate is generated as \(X_{i1} \sim N(0, 1)\), and for \(t \geq 2\),

\[
X_{it} = Y_{it} + N(0, 1).
\]

The randomization probability \(p_t\) is constant at \(1/2\). The
exogenous noise is \(\epsilon_{it+1} \sim N(0, \sigma_\epsilon^2)\).

In GM2, we considered the case where \(Z_{i(t_0)} = Z_{i(t_2)} = 1\),
with time-varying randomization probability. The outcome is generated
as:

\[
Y_{it+1} = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 X_{it} + b_{i0} + b_{i1} X_{it} + A_{it} (\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{it} + b_{i2} + b_{i3} X_{it}) + \epsilon_{it+1}.
\]

The random effects \(b_{ij} \sim N(0, \sigma_{b_j}^2)\), for
\(0 \leq j \leq 3\), are independent of each other. The covariate is
generated as \(X_{i1} \sim N(0, 1)\), and for \(t \geq 2\),

\[
X_{it} = Y_{it} + N(0, 1).
\]

The randomization probability depends on \(X_{it}\):

\[
p_t = 0.7 \cdot 1(X_{it} > -1.27) + 0.3 \cdot 1(X_{it} \leq -1.27),
\]

where \(1(\cdot)\) represents the indicator function, and the cutoff
\(-1.27\) was chosen so that \(p_t\) equals 0.7 or 0.3 for about half of
the time. The exogenous noise is
\(\epsilon_{it+1} \sim N(0, \sigma_\epsilon^2)\).

GM3 is the same as GM 1, except that the covariate \(X_{it}\) depends
directly on \(b_i\):

\[
X_{i1} \sim N(b_{i0}, 1), \quad X_{it} = Y_{it} + N(b_{i0}, 1) \text{ for } t \geq 2.
\]

We chose the following parameter values:

\[
\alpha_0 = -2, \quad \alpha_1 = -0.3, \quad \beta_0 = 1, \quad \beta_1 = 0.3,

\subsection{Simulation Plan Proposal}\label{simulation-plan-proposal}

To uncover the undesirable effects of endogenous covariates and
investigate robustness against these effects, we will carry out
simulations in which data will be generated according to several
increasingly complex scenarios. These scenarios will be visually
represented using directed acyclic graphs and analyzed using GEE, MLM
and DSEM. We will start out with a scenario of the basic MLM---where a
time-varying outcome \(Y\) is regressed on a single time-varying
predictor \(X\) and in the presence of stable between person differences
in the intercept---and increase the complexity until we reach the
scenario that includes a time-varying endogenous covariate. The primary
interest of this simulation study is the comparative performance of
different specifications of the MLM and GEE in terms of bias in the
estimation of the effect of \(X\) to \(Y\). The secondary interest is
the efficiency in mean squared error (MSE). We consider settings with
timepoints \(T = 10,30\) and sample size \(N = 30, 100, 200\).

Statistical analyses pertaining to the GEE and basic MLM will be
performed in \texttt{R}, version 4.4.2
(\citeproc{ref-rcoreteam2024}{Team, 2024}). To fit the GEE, the
R-package \texttt{geepack} (\citeproc{ref-halekoh2006}{Halekoh et al.,
2006}) will evaluate several different working correlation structures,
including independent, exchangeable, AR(1) and unstructured. To fit the
basic MLM, the R-package \texttt{lme4} (\citeproc{ref-bates2015}{Bates
et al., 2015}) will be employed, where we will use restricted maximum
likelihood estimation.
