\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Across a wide range of disciplines, researchers analyze clustered
longitudinal, observational data to investigate prospective causal
relationships between variables. When analyzing such data, the
psychological sciences most commonly resort to the multilevel linear
model (MLM, \citeproc{ref-mcneish2017}{McNeish et al., 2017}),
which---in the context of longitudinal data analysis---separates
observed variance into stable between-person differences and
within-person fluctuations (\citeproc{ref-hamaker2020}{Hamaker \&
Muth√©n, 2020}). Conversely, other fields, such as biostatistics and
econometrics often favour generalized estimating equations (GEE) for the
analysis of longitudinal data (\citeproc{ref-mcneish2017}{McNeish et
al., 2017}). Despite some cross-disciplinary efforts to compare these
methods (\citeproc{ref-mcneish2017}{McNeish et al., 2017};
\citeproc{ref-muth2016}{Muth et al., 2016}; \citeproc{ref-yan2013}{Yan
et al., 2013}), their scarcity may leave researchers with limited
guidance in choosing the most suitable approach for their application.

Recent evidence has highlighted an issue present in both methods, where
controlling for \emph{time-varying endogenous covariates} may lead to
biased causal estimates (\citeproc{ref-pepe1994}{Pepe \& Anderson,
1994}; \citeproc{ref-qian2020}{Qian et al., 2020}). A time-varying
covariate is \emph{endogenous} if it is directly or indirectly
influenced by prior treatment or outcome, meaning its value may be
determined by earlier stages of the process
(\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{Qian et al., 2020}). As a result of including
these covariates in the mentioned models, ordinary interpretations of
the coefficients are no longer valid (\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{Qian et
al., 2020, p. 3}). According to Diggle
(\citeproc{ref-diggle2002}{2002}), this issue not only pertains GEE and
MLM, but \emph{all} longitudinal data analysis methods.

However, due to a divide between the disciplines that employ these
methods, such critiques of the MLM appear to have largely failed to
reach the applied researcher in psychology. One specific reason might be
that the technical jargon in other disciplines makes it difficult for
researchers to recognize when and how these issues emerge\footnote{For
  instance, the term `endogeneity' in econometrics, while related, has a
  distinct meaning from that of an endogenous variable, which can lead
  to confusion.}. As a result, researchers may address related problems
in disconnected literatures but fail to understand each other. For
instance, while the MLM literature emphasizes on the distinction between
different centering methods and the effect of cross-level interactions
on parameter interpretations (e.g., \citeproc{ref-hamaker2020}{Hamaker
\& Muth√©n, 2020}), the GEE literature appears to focus more on the
marginal and conditional interpretations of model parameters (e.g.,
\citeproc{ref-pepe1994}{Pepe \& Anderson, 1994}).

Through a cross-fertilization of these literatures, this project aims to
(1) explain the issue of including endogenous covariates in analyses
involving GEE, MLM and DSEM (a widely used framework in the social
sciences based on MLM) in a psychological context and (2) establish
guidelines on how researchers can prevent this issue in their
longitudinal data analysis. Accordingly, the following research
questions will be addressed: \emph{In which cases do the inclusion of
endogenous variables in multilevel linear models and generalized
estimating equations result in a discrepancy between marginal and
conditional estimates?} In line with the literature
(\citeproc{ref-diggle2002}{Diggle, 2002}; \citeproc{ref-pepe1994}{Pepe
\& Anderson, 1994}; \citeproc{ref-qian2020}{Qian et al., 2020}), we
expect that the inclusion of endogenous time-varying covariates in
longitudinal data analyses may result in bias that---depending on the
circumstances---can promote the potential for faulty inferences. To
isolate the issue described in Qian et al.
(\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{2020}), we will focus on the following
sub-questions: (1) When removing the interaction \(\beta_1\) from
generative model 3, is there a difference between the marginal and
conditional estimates of the treatment effect? (2) When removing the
random slope \(b_{i2}\) from generative model 3, is there a difference
between the marginal and conditional estimates of the treatment effect?

\newpage

\section{Methods}\label{methods}

To obtain a better understanding of the issue exposed by Qian et al.
(\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{2020}), two methods were employed. First,
graphical methods were used provide insight into the presence and extent
of bias with potential violation of assumptions: (a) path diagrams were
used to evaluate the conditional independence assumption and (b)
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) were used to evaluate the backdoor
criterion (Pearl, 1988, 2009). Second, a simulation study was performed
to reproduce the results for the generative models (GMs) from Qian et
al. (\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{2020}) and to further isolate the issue
using additional GMs.

\subsection{Data Generation}\label{data-generation}

In the simulation Qian et al. (\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{2020}) considered
three generative models (GMs), all of which have an endogenous
time-varying covariate. In GM1 and GM2, the endogenous covariate
\(X_{it}\) equals the previous outcome \(Y_{it}\) plus some random
noise, so the \emph{conditional independence} assumption is valid. In
GM3, the endogenous covariate depends directly on \(b_{i0}\), violating
the assumption. To isolate the issue in GM3, we consider two variations
on this model: GM3A, where the random slope \(b_{i2}\) for the treatment
\(A_{it}\) is removed; GM3B, where the interaction term
\(\beta_1 A_{it} X_{it}\) is removed. Note that the conditional
independence assumption is violated in either of these variations. The
details of the generative models are described below. We follow the
notation of Qian et al. (\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{2020}) to allow for
direct comparison, but rewrite the equations into within- and
between-person models (see \citeproc{ref-raudenbush2002}{Raudenbush \&
Bryk, 2002}). We accompany the equations of the GMs with graphical
representations, where random effects are represented by grey circles,
observed variables by squares and relationships across variables by
arrows. The path diagrams of the three data generating models shows the
discrepancies between the different generative models---especially
concerning the interaction effects---more clearly than DAGs.

\subsubsection{Generative Model 1}\label{generative-model-1}

In GM1, we considered a simple case with only a random intercept and a
random slope for \(X_{it}\). The outcome is generated according to the
following repeated-observations or within-person model (level 1):

\[
Y_{it+1} = \pi_{0i} + \pi_{1i} X_{it} + \pi_{2i} A_{it} + \pi_{3i} A_{it} X_{it} + \epsilon_{it+1}
\]

with the person-level or between-person model (level 2):

\[
\pi_{0i} = \alpha_0 + b_{i0}, \quad b_{i0} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{b0}^2),
\]

\[
\pi_{1i} = \alpha_1,
\]

\[
\pi_{2i} = \beta_0 + b_{i2}, \quad b_{i2} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{b2}^2),
\]

\[
\pi_{3i} = \beta_1.
\]

By substitution, we get the single equation model:

\[
\begin{aligned}
Y_{it+1} &= \pi_{0i} + \pi_{1i} X_{it} + \pi_{2i} A_{it} + \pi_{3i} A_{it} X_{it} + \epsilon_{it+1} \\
&= (\alpha_0 + b_{i0}) + \alpha_1 X_{it} + (\beta_0 + b_{i2}) A_{it} + \beta_1 A_{it} X_{it} + \epsilon_{it+1} \\
&= \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 X_{it} + b_{i0} + A_{it} (\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{it} + b_{i2}) + \epsilon_{it+1}.
\end{aligned}
\]

The random effects \(b_{i0} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{b0}^2)\) and
\(b_{i2} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{b2}^2)\) are independent of each
other. The covariate is generated as \(X_{i1} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)\),
and for \(t \geq 2\),

\[
X_{it} = Y_{it} + \mathcal{N}(0, 1).
\]

The randomization probability \(p_t = P(A_{it} = 1 \mid H_{it})\) is
constant at \(1/2\). Thus, \(A_{it} \sim \text{Bernoulli}(0.5)\) for
\(i = 1, \ldots, N\) and \(t = 1, \ldots, T\). The exogenous noise is
\(\epsilon_{it+1} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_\epsilon^2)\).

Figure~\ref{fig-GM1_path} shows the path diagram for GM3.

\begin{figure}[H]

(\(t = 1, 2, 3\))}

\centering{

\includegraphics{research-report_files/figure-pdf/fig-GM1_path-1.pdf}

}

\end{figure}%

\subsubsection{Generative Model 2}\label{generative-model-2}

In GM2, we considered the case with a random intercept and random slopes
for (1) covariate \(X_{it}\), (2) treatment \(A_{it}\), and (3) the
interaction between \(A_{it}\) and \(X_{it}\); and with a time-varying
randomization probability for treatment. The outcome is generated
according to the same repeated-observations model presented in GM1.
However, the person-level model is different:

\[
\pi_{0i} = \alpha_0 + b_{i0}, \quad b_{i0} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{b0}^2),
\]

\[
\pi_{1i} = \alpha_1 + b_{i1}, \quad b_{i1} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{b1}^2),
\]

\[
\pi_{2i} = \beta_0 + b_{i2}, \quad b_{i2} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{b2}^2),
\]

\[
\pi_{3i} = \beta_1 + b_{i3}, \quad b_{i3} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{b3}^2).
\]

By substitution, we get the single equation model:

\[
\begin{aligned}
Y_{it+1} &= \pi_{0i} + \pi_{1i} X_{it} + \pi_{2i} A_{it} + \pi_{3i} A_{it} X_{it} + \epsilon_{it+1} \\ 
&= (\alpha_0 + b_{i0}) + (\alpha_1 + b_{i1}) X_{it} + (\beta_0 + b_{i2}) A_{it} + (\beta_1 + b_{i3}) A_{it} X_{it} + \epsilon_{it+1} \\ 
&= \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 X_{it} + b_{i0} + b_{i1} X_{it} + A_{it} \left( \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{it} + b_{i2} + b_{i3} X_{it} \right) + \epsilon_{it+1}.
\end{aligned}
\]

The random effects \(b_{ij} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{bj}^2)\), for
\(j = 0, 1, 2, 3\), are independent of each other. The covariate is
generated as \(X_{i1} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)\), and for \(t \geq 2\),

\[
X_{it} = Y_{it} + \mathcal{N}(0, 1).
\]

The randomization probability depends on \(X_{it}\):

\[
p_t = P(A_{it} = 1 \mid H_{it}) = 
\begin{cases} 
0.7 & \text{if } X_{it} > -1.27, \\
0.3 & \text{if } X_{it} \leq -1.27,
\end{cases}
\]

where the cutoff \(-1.27\) was chosen so that \(p_t\) equals 0.7 or 0.3
for about half of the time. In other words, if the value of the
covariate for any given person and time point is above the cutoff, the
probability of receiving the treatment \(p_t\) is 0.7; otherwise, it is
0.3. Accordingly, \(A_{it} \sim \text{Bernoulli}(p_t)\) for
\(i = 1, \ldots, N\) and \(t = 1, \ldots, T\). The exogenous noise is
\(\epsilon_{it+1} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_\epsilon^2)\).

\subsubsection{Generative Model 3}\label{generative-model-3}

GM3 is the same as GM1, except that the covariate \(X_{it}\) depends
directly on \(b_{i0}\):

\[
X_{i1} \sim \mathcal{N}(b_{i0}, 1), \quad X_{it} = Y_{it} + \mathcal{N}(b_{i0}, 1) \text{ for } t \geq 2.
\]

Figure~\ref{fig-GM3_path} shows the path diagram for GM3.

\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics{research-report_files/figure-pdf/fig-GM3_path-1.pdf}

}

\end{figure}%

\subsubsection{Generative Model 3A}\label{generative-model-3a}

GM3A is the same as GM3, except that the random slope \(b_{i2}\) for the
treatment \(A_{it}\) is removed. The single equation model then becomes:

\[
Y_{it+1} = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 X_{it} + b_{i0} + A_{it} (\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{it}) + \epsilon_{it+1}.
\]

(\(t = 1, 2, 3\))}

}

\end{figure}%

\subsubsection{Generative Model 3B}\label{generative-model-3b}

GM3B is the same as GM3, except that the interaction term
\(\beta_1 A_{it} X_{it}\) is removed. The single equation model then
becomes:

\[
Y_{it+1} = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 X_{it} + b_{i0} + A_{it} (\beta_0 + b_{i2}) + \epsilon_{it+1}.
\]

\begin{figure}[H]

(\(t = 1, 2, 3\))}

\centering{

\includegraphics{research-report_files/figure-pdf/fig-GM3B_path-1.pdf}

}

\end{figure}%

\subsubsection{Parameter Values}\label{parameter-values}

The following parameter values were adapted from Qian et al.
(\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{2020}):

\[
\alpha_0 = -2, \quad \alpha_1 = -0.3, \quad \beta_0 = 1, \quad \beta_1 = 0.3,
\]

\[
\sigma_{b0}^2 = 4, \quad \sigma_{b1}^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad \sigma_{b2}^2 = 1, \quad \sigma_{b3}^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad \sigma_\epsilon^2 = 1.
\]

\subsection{Path Diagrams and Conditional
Independence}\label{path-diagrams-and-conditional-independence}

Qian et al. (\citeproc{ref-qian2020}{2020}) proposes the use of the
conditional independence assumption to identify whether bias may occur,
which is given by:

\[ X_{it} \perp (b_{i0}, b_{i1}) \mid H_{it-1}, A_{it-1}, Y_{it}. \]

This allows \(X_{it}\) to be endogenous, but the endogenous covariate
\(X_{it}\) can only depend on the random effects through variables
observed prior to \(X_{it}\). If the only endogenous covariates are
functions of prior treatments and prior outcomes, then the assumption
automatically holds.

When inspecting Figure~\ref{fig-GM1_path} and \textbf{?@fig-GM2\_path},
we may notice that \(X_{it}\) becomes independent of the random effects
after conditioning on \(Y_{it}\). On the other hand, we can see that
this assumption is violated in GM3/GM3A/GM3B, as \(X_{it}\) depends
directly on \(b_{i0}\) and can thus not be made independent of the
random effects by conditioning on prior variables such as \(Y_{it}\)
(see Figure~\ref{fig-GM3_path}, Figure~\ref{fig-GM3A_path} and
Figure~\ref{fig-GM3B_path})

\subsection{Backdoor Criterion and
DAGs}\label{backdoor-criterion-and-dags}

We formulated the DAGs in \texttt{dagitty}, where the random disturbance
\(b_{0i}\) was represented by the node U (e.g.,
\citeproc{ref-Kim2021a}{Kim \& Steiner, 2021}).

\begin{quote}
``According to the backdoor criterion (Pearl, 1988, 2009) or the
adjustment criterion (Shpitser, VanderWeele, \& Robins, 2010),
identification of causal effects requires that all non-causal paths are
blocked by conditioning on middle variables on the non-causal paths
(i.e., by controlling for or matching on the variables). If it is not
possible to block all non-causal paths due to omitted or unreliably
measured variables, the treatment and outcome remain connected via
non-causal (or backdoor) paths and the remaining confounding association
biases the effect estimators. In Figure 1b, since U is unmeasured, the
non-causal path A2 U ! Y 2 cannot be blocked,'' (Kim and Steiner, 2021)
\end{quote}

The DAGs for the first three observations of the three data generating
models are presented in Figure~\ref{fig-DAGs}. The red arrows show the
biased paths after controlling for the covariate \(X_{it}\).

REMAKE THEM IN TIKZ (USE CHATGPT), MAKE backdoor path ARROW RED FOR GM2.

\begin{figure}[H]

\begin{minipage}{0.50\linewidth}

\end{figure}%

\begin{quote}
According to the backdoor criterion (Pearl, 1988, 2009) or the
adjustment criterion (Shpitser, VanderWeele, \& Robins, 2010),
identification of causal effects requires that all non-causal paths are
blocked by conditioning on middle variables on the non-causal paths
(i.e., by controlling for or matching on the variables). If it is not
possible to block all non-causal paths due to omitted or unreliably
measured variables, the treatment and outcome remain connected via
non-causal (or backdoor) paths and the remaining confounding association
biases the effect estimators
\end{quote}

When applying Pearl's backdoor criterion to GM1 and GM3, it may be
observed that there exists no backdoor path in the treatment effect
\(A_{it} \to Y_{it+1}\). On the other hand, in GM2, there is a backdoor
path in the treatment effect:
\(A_{it} \leftarrow X_{it} \rightarrow Y_{it+1}\). Thus, Pearl's
backdoor criterion fails to identify when the treatment effect is
biased.

Note, however, that limitations to Pearl's backdoor criterion have been
voiced by several people, when there are interaction effects/
modification effects.

\subsection{Data Analysis}\label{data-analysis}

We evaluated the performance of the models across a total of 30
different settings, each replicated 1,000 times, by systematically
varying the following factors:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Generative Models (GM):} 1, 2, 3, 3A, 3B
\item
  \textbf{Number of timepoints (T):} 10, 30
\item
  \textbf{Sample size (N):} 30, 100, 200
\end{itemize}

All data generation and estimation was performed in \texttt{R}, version
4.4.2 (\citeproc{ref-rcoreteam2024}{Team, 2024}). To fit the standard
MLM, the \texttt{lmer} function from the R-package \texttt{lme4}
(\citeproc{ref-bates2015}{Bates et al., 2015}) was employed with
restricted maximum likelihood estimation. For the MLM, the analytical
models were equivalent to each of the respective data-generating models.
To fit the GEE with the ``exchangeable'', ``independent'' and ``AR(1)''
working correlation structures, the \texttt{geeglm} function from the
R-package \texttt{geepack} (\citeproc{ref-halekoh2006}{Halekoh et al.,
2006}) was employed with the identity link function. Since the random
effects are not explicitly modelled in GEE, the analytical GEE models
simply contain only the fixed effects of the generative model at hand.

\section{Appendix}\label{appendix}

\subsection{Original Section from Qian et al.~(2020): ``4.
Simulation''}\label{original-section-from-qian-et-al.-2020-4.-simulation}

In the simulation, we considered three generative models (GMs), all of
which have an endogenous covariate. In the first two GMs, the endogenous
covariate \(X_{it}\) equals the previous outcome \(Y_{it}\) plus some
random noise, so the conditional independence assumption (10) is valid.
In GM 3, the endogenous covariate depends directly on \(b_i\), violating
assumption (10). The details of the generative models are described
below.

In GM1, we considered a simple case with only a random intercept and a
random slope for \(A_{it}\), so that \(Z_{i(t_0)} = Z_{i(t_2)} = 1\) in
model (7). The outcome is generated as:

\[
Y_{it+1} = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 X_{it} + b_{i0} + A_{it} (\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{it} + b_{i2}) + \epsilon_{it+1}.
\]

The random effects \(b_{i0} \sim N(0, \sigma_{b0}^2)\) and
\(b_{i2} \sim N(0, \sigma_{b2}^2)\) are independent of each other. The
covariate is generated as \(X_{i1} \sim N(0, 1)\), and for \(t \geq 2\),

\[
X_{it} = Y_{it} + N(0, 1).
\]

The randomization probability \(p_t\) is constant at \(1/2\). The
exogenous noise is \(\epsilon_{it+1} \sim N(0, \sigma_\epsilon^2)\).

In GM2, we considered the case where \(Z_{i(t_0)} = Z_{i(t_2)} = 1\),
with time-varying randomization probability. The outcome is generated
as:

\[
Y_{it+1} = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 X_{it} + b_{i0} + b_{i1} X_{it} + A_{it} (\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{it} + b_{i2} + b_{i3} X_{it}) + \epsilon_{it+1}.
\]

The random effects \(b_{ij} \sim N(0, \sigma_{b_j}^2)\), for
\(0 \leq j \leq 3\), are independent of each other. The covariate is
generated as \(X_{i1} \sim N(0, 1)\), and for \(t \geq 2\),

\[
X_{it} = Y_{it} + N(0, 1).
\]

The randomization probability depends on \(X_{it}\):

\[
p_t = 0.7 \cdot 1(X_{it} > -1.27) + 0.3 \cdot 1(X_{it} \leq -1.27),
\]

where \(1(\cdot)\) represents the indicator function, and the cutoff
\(-1.27\) was chosen so that \(p_t\) equals 0.7 or 0.3 for about half of
the time. The exogenous noise is
\(\epsilon_{it+1} \sim N(0, \sigma_\epsilon^2)\).

GM3 is the same as GM 1, except that the covariate \(X_{it}\) depends
directly on \(b_i\):

\[
X_{i1} \sim N(b_{i0}, 1), \quad X_{it} = Y_{it} + N(b_{i0}, 1) \text{ for } t \geq 2.
\]

We chose the following parameter values:

\[
\alpha_0 = -2, \quad \alpha_1 = -0.3, \quad \beta_0 = 1, \quad \beta_1 = 0.3,
\]

\[
\sigma_{b0}^2 = 4, \quad \sigma_{b1}^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad \sigma_{b2}^2 = 1, \quad \sigma_{b3}^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad \sigma_\epsilon^2 = 1.
\]

\subsection{Simulation Plan Proposal}\label{simulation-plan-proposal}

To uncover the undesirable effects of endogenous covariates and
investigate robustness against these effects, we will carry out
simulations in which data will be generated according to several
increasingly complex scenarios. These scenarios will be visually
represented using directed acyclic graphs and analyzed using GEE, MLM
and DSEM. We will start out with a scenario of the basic MLM---where a
time-varying outcome \(Y\) is regressed on a single time-varying
predictor \(X\) and in the presence of stable between person differences
in the intercept---and increase the complexity until we reach the
scenario that includes a time-varying endogenous covariate. The primary
interest of this simulation study is the comparative performance of
different specifications of the MLM and GEE in terms of bias in the
estimation of the effect of \(X\) to \(Y\). The secondary interest is
the efficiency in mean squared error (MSE). We consider settings with
timepoints \(T = 10,30\) and sample size \(N = 30, 100, 200\).

Statistical analyses pertaining to the GEE and basic MLM will be
performed in \texttt{R}, version 4.4.2
(\citeproc{ref-rcoreteam2024}{Team, 2024}). To fit the GEE, the
R-package \texttt{geepack} (\citeproc{ref-halekoh2006}{Halekoh et al.,
2006}) will evaluate several different working correlation structures,
including independent, exchangeable, AR(1) and unstructured. To fit the
basic MLM, the R-package \texttt{lme4} (\citeproc{ref-bates2015}{Bates
et al., 2015}) will be employed, where we will use restricted maximum
likelihood estimation.
